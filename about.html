                            <p class="headings"> Billow Beach is a private beach association in Saybrook, OH - a suburb of the city of Ashtabula. Billow Beach is located just off of Route 45 off of Lake Road, and is less than 5 miles away from the popular resort Geneva-on-the-Lake. </p>
                            <p class="headings"> Once was the home of a popular local restaurant, Lou's Billow Beach was founded by Louis, "Lou" Dehelion. The restaurant was a hot ticket in town for both out-of-towners, and local residents. Home of the popular Bubble Bar, the restaurant was acclaimed for its vibrant atmosphere and friendly service. </p>
                            <p class="headings"> However, circa 2008, the restaurant declared bankruptcy, and was forced to close operations. To the dismay of many local residents and frequent patrons, many clamored for the restaurant to return. In 2010, the building and lot was purchased, and was assumed that the restaurant would reopen for operation. But, this would not be the case.  </p>
                            <p class="headings"> When the property was purchased, it was declared for use as office buildings, and immediately went under renovation. The following summer, however, the operation was canceled, after a complete overhaul of the restaurant. </p>
                            <p class="headings"> After many years of absence, the restaurant would return. In 2012, investor Robert Dunlap built on the previous renovations, and after investing nearly half a million dollars, the restaurant reopened in 2013. The restaurant payed homage to its predecessor, and was retitled Lou's Billow Beach.  </p>
                            <p class="headings"> Things did not go well for the second iteration of Lou's, however. Plagued by poor service and bad management, the restaurant could not survive the brutal Ashtabula winters, despite having a beautiful new look. In late 2014, within 2 seasons of opening, the restaurant closed. In early 2015, it was announced that the restaurant would reopen, but would ditch Lou's Billow Beach to become a Mexican restaurant. </p>
                            <p class="headings"> In June of 2015, the iconic Lou's Billow Beach sign was destroyed, and new management has taken over. Despite promising to deliver quality, authentic, and genuine Mexican cuisine, the restaurant gave no ETA for opening. At the time of this publication, the restaurant is still "coming soon." </p>

                            <p class="headings"> Billow Beach features 4 rows of beautiful cottages, right on the cusp of Lake Erie. Each cottage is about 10 feet or less away from each other, which gives a strong sense of community and family. Adjacent to the right of Billow Beach, is the community of Hallwood, and to the left, condos. </p>
                            <p class="headings"> Each cottage is less than a 2 minute walk to the beach, and many are even less than that. On the beach, residents and guests enjoy the newly constructed viewing deck at the bottom, or take a swim in the refreshing lake. Billow Beach is a private beach, so not only are pets, fires, boats, and children permitted - in fact, they're encouraged!  </p>
                            <p class="headings"> Many attractions are right around the area, including popular resort Geneva-on-the-Lake, The Ashtabula Harbor, Geneva State Park, and many more.   </p>
