                    <p class="headings"> Paul addressed projects from last year. The deck project was approved for $1550 and total expenses for the deck ended up being just over $2000 due to extra materials and expenses. However, on the positive side the step staining came in about $130 less and snow plowing was a little less than anticipated. </p>

                    <p class="headings">  Dean requested an explanation regarding the money spent to unplug the sewer. Vice President Al Felix explained that he was here and when he flushed to toilet the sewers were all backed up. f lis shower drain was also plugged so he called a Rota Rooter. Sewers were clogged by grease. Please he mindful of what is put down our drains. Also, if you have renters please ask they be careful what they put dispose of in the drain. </p>

                    <p class="headings"> There was further discussion regarding our aged water lines. Paul said the cost to replace would be between $30,000 - $40,000 dollars. With new standards we would have to install fire hydrants in addition to new water lines. Al and Paul mentioned that he thinks that the water lines on the east road may have been replaced when the restaurant was being remodeled (back in Lou's Billow Beach days - Lou Dehelion). Al said back then we paid for the sewer but never saw any bill for the lines. Gary mentioned that Environmental Services may be able to advise if the lines have been replaced on the east road by the restaurant.  </p>

                <p class="headings"> <b> Snow Plowing </b> </p>
                <p class="headings"> Paul H. opened up a discussion regarding snow plowing. Currently, BBA averages approximately $1000-$1200 per year for plowing. Paul Shagnot paid $10/push for the east road plowing last winter. There are six residents that reside year round and several do not contribute anything towards this benefit. Non-paying residents take quite a toll on the operation; approximately 30% of our money is spent on snow removal. This is a discussion to be continued and possibly re-visit after dues are paid for 2015.
                <p class="headings"> Lisa mentioned that we should maybe check with our insurance company to see if there is any type of requirement for BBA to provide access on the private roads during the winter. </p>
                <p class="headings"> &nbsp;</p>
                <p class="headings"> <b> Northeast Road Concrete </b></p>
                <p class="headings"> Dean provided an update on the northeast road possible project that's been discussed over the past few years. He sent a letter to the 7 residents to get feedback. He received 3 responses. To do the road would be approximately 10 x 240 feet for concrete road; <i> The estimated cost would be approximately $12,000</i> </p>
                <p class="headings"> However, 7 feet of this would require an estimate from the restaurant property owners. Gary had a contractor review the project and recommendation was to stay with slag. In order to do it with concrete would require approximately 2 feet of excavation.</p>
                <p class="headings"> Ron mentioned that before we do more gravel to look into mixing Ready Mix in with the gravel which makes it a more stable surface. This will be an on-going project and discussion. </p>
